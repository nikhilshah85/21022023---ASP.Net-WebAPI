We saw how to consume to WebAPI
	a. Client side - fetch
	b. Server Side - C# - HttpClient 

	This was a  call to other api, which was free and open to everyone
	But this is not the case of webapi that u create

	So webapi applictions does not allow access by default - all the calls are blocked
		by a feature called CORS - cross origin resourse shareing

CORS ERROR - 

Products:1 Access to fetch at 'https://localhost:7073/api/Products' from origin 'https://localhost:7003' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
Products:48          GET https://localhost:7073/api/Products net::ERR_FAILED 200





builder.Services.AddCors(policy =>
{
    policy.AddDefaultPolicy(defaultPOl =>
    {
        defaultPOl.AllowAnyHeader().AllowAnyMethod().AllowAnyOrigin();
    });
});



app.UseCors();
