As a developer we have been createing a lot of objects in other classes

But we never write any code to destroy the object, destructor, dispose() - method

Because - GC come and clear the resource

But this days, number of users has increased a lot and keeps on increasing

------------------------------------
		Thus newer framework this days, says do not create any Object inside other classes

		Let framework create those object and inject, and framework will also destroy the same based on 3 method configuration

			There are 3 methods in .net core to specify when to destroy the object 

			a. AddTranscient - create new object for every call and destroy the object once output is processed
				PerCall - use for dynamic data - eg. stock market rates, cricket score etc...
			b. AddScoped - create a new object for every user and destroy the object when user session is over
				PerSession - user specific data - Bankaccount
			c. AddSingeTon - create a new object on start of application and destroy when applicaiton stops
				SingleTon - use


		This is implemented in 2 steps
			1. inside the class where u want object of other class, 
	         		create a new variable (do not instantiate it) - eg. Employee _empObj;
		             create a constuctor with a parameter of that class, (this the reference to object created by framework)
			2. In program.cs - use 1 of the method discussed above
